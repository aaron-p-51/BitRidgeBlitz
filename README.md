## Game Details
In the back of a local bowling alley sits a dusty arcade room. Only one of the machines still works.
Even though no one has been seen playing the arcade machine in ages, the roomâ€™s lights are always left on and the machine runs perpetually.
After bowling for a few hours with your friends, you decide to poke your head into the arcade to check things out.
